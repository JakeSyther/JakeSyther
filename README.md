-  Welcome, We're Reverse-A Studios (Alpha).
-  We are interested in science fiction - action cinematic, games, visuals and designs.
-  We're currently working on game engines with language(C# && CPP)based on, and with a variety of Modelling Tools.
-  We are currently preparing a story based on science fiction and action. Our ultimate goal is to contribute to science by imagining technology beyond the ages,            completely beyond current science. We will go through many topics independent of the main topic, even though each story is connected with the other, at the end of the    story you will eventually face a completely different reality. Moreover, the story will take you to the present day in the last chapter within a different reality,      and it will continue uninterruptedly, based on action with many world wars. You'll face the reasons for the political and chaotic order that prevents the advanced age    of humanity from having superior technology, in the end.
-  The main founder promised that 50% and more of the total revenues will be spent on the production and development of self-manufacturing and distribution of artificial    intelligence mobile vehicles and drones which protecting the diverse nature and enabling it to expand in order to improve our home = the planet "Earth".
-  In this way, we believe that we will overcome the global food crisis in the world and that we will save many future scientists, doctors and engineers from starvation.
-  We are burning with the dream of a world where babies do not die. We are aware that we need to work hard for a more beautiful world.
